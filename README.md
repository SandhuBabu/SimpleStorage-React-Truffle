This blockchain project is built using React, Truffle, Ganache, and Web3.js. It allows users to save and retrieve integer values on the Ethereum blockchain. The project includes a function setter that takes an integer value as input and saves it to the blockchain. The saved value can be retrieved at any time using a function getter.

Web3.js is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain from within the React application. The front-end of the project is built using React, which provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the blockchain. The back-end is built using Truffle, which makes it easy to deploy and test smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Ganache is used as the local blockchain network for testing and development purposes.

The project demonstrates the power and flexibility of blockchain technology, as well as the ease with which it can be integrated into modern web applications using tools like React, Truffle, Ganache, and Web3.js. By allowing users to save and retrieve integer values on the blockchain, the project highlights the potential for blockchain-based data storage and retrieval in a variety of real-world use cases.
